Planet Editor:
	Maybe multipliers not in here?
	Bug when create new planet stops sliders from working??? (Maybe look at Pause())

Placing Object:
	Initial starting distance (height)
	Angle (look at how its done currently)
	Normal (3D)

3d:
	Need to add planet editor
	Add drag and drop
	Maybe user move camera
	Grid lines?
	Think of ways to display educational stuffs
	Maybe nested tool tip - Victoria 3

Investigate speed multiplier (maybe increase fixed update speed)

Change Gantt chart - include other cws

Change name if planet

Education
	Think of lessons
	How can this be helpful
	Adding objects tells more about what it is

Preset values of planets in solar system

Make solar system demo
	Or premade scenarios (own scenes click on from 2D menu)
	Trinary star systems?
	

Issues with collisions
	How close do they need to be?
	Delete the smallest object


Reza:

Better user expierence
Looks good too

Do task first then 2d/3d


Identify different stakeholders
	Identify needs of each (user storues)
	Fulfil this requirement
	Ask what people want

Look at more similar projects
	Why is mine better/useful
	(maybe to learn unity)
	(maybe need to make others simplier)
