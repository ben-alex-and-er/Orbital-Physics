Planet Editor:
	Maybe multipliers not in here?
	Bug when create new planet stops sliders from working??? (Maybe look at Pause())

Placing Object:
	Initial starting distance (height)
	Angle (look at how its done currently)
	Normal (3D)

3d:
	Need to add planet editor
	Updating planet editor (when running) changes path of planet
	Add drag and drop?
	Maybe user move camera
	Grid lines?
	Think of ways to display educational stuffs
	Maybe nested tool tip - Victoria 3


Change Gantt chart - include other cws
Change name if planet

Add demo tick button - that unlocks all lessons
Move Camera in 3d
Temperature for planet that changes in eliptical orbit

Education
	Think of lessons
	How can this be helpful
	Adding objects tells more about what it is
	Have 'quests' that students do and move on to next one
		Have structure
		Start with changing mass etc
		Maybe then go to making a stable orbit

		Orbital frequency can be determined by when the angle hits a value

	Try to link the dialogue to the game (tooltips)
		Not just a wall of text

Preset values of planets in solar system

Make solar system demo
	Or premade scenarios (own scenes click on from 2D menu)
	Trinary star systems?
	

Issues with collisions
	How close do they need to be?
	Delete the smallest object


Reza:

Better user expierence
Looks good too

Do task first then 2d/3d


Identify different stakeholders
	Identify needs of each (user storues)
	Fulfil this requirement
	Ask what people want

Look at more similar projects
	Why is mine better/useful
	(maybe to learn unity)
	(maybe need to make others simplier)


Report
	Project management (includes initial estimation and second gantt chart)
		Explain how and why it changed (cut corners etc)
	Evaluation
		What went well
		What didnt
		Product evaluation
			What people liked etc
	Implementation Chapter
	Intro
		Problem statement (new one)
		Solution
			Planning to build to fix
			Using unity
	Stakeholder analysis
	Background
		Existing tools
			Why Unity
		Exisring apps similar
		Education stuff
	Conclusion
		Future work


Make cylinders for axis

Ideas:
	Distance bar
	Test 3d but with only 2d code to see why it glitches
		Error occurs when angles are 90 etc
		Weirdly the planet flies away when depth angle is set


	Typing in input box glitch
	Add lesson???
	Drag and drop in 3D
